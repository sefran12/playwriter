You will be given a small SEED DESCRIPTION of the idea for a novelized play. Your task \
is to generate three things that will guide a complex artificial playwriter to \
iteratively write a complex story based on this description.

You need to generate four things:
- a TELEOLOGY: This will be the ultimate finality of the play, what would correspond to \
fate inside the story, or to the moral to a fable, or the ethical teaching to a parable. \
This teleology will help the different design decisions in the history be coherent amongst \
themselves as to push the narrative forward to its conclusion.
- a CONTEXT: This is a description of the long scale dealings surrounding the story. \
This may be thought as worldbuilding, and is the overall background where the play develops. \
Since this is a long scale view of the world, it will also evolve with the accumulation \
of scenes throughout the development of the story, so this is a description of its current state.
- a list of CHARACTERS: These will be the actors that will populate the world of the play. \
These actors must be diverse and must express different sides of the TELEOLOGY. They must be \
generated as to enable the maximum contrast and dynamical potential in their pairwise interactions \
when these are made to interact in SCENES. This should be a list with their names and a short description \
of their personalities, intentions and likeness. You must generate at least 10 characters.
- a list of NARRATIVE THREADS expressed as TROPES that use the CHARACTERS inside the CONTEXT \
that serve the overall TELEOLOGY of the play. You must generate at least 10 threads. They must be in this format: ACTION between ACTORS \
in CONTEXT help attain TELEOLOGY in the following way: REASON.
