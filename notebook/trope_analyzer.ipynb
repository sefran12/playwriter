      "Catchphrases are a great and simple way to help a character's image. But sometimes, catchphrases don't stick. Perhaps the writers were experimenting with one early on, but eventually decided against it. Or perhaps a catchphrase was done to death and is no longer funny. Or sometimes, a character simply evolves and the catchphrase no longer fits the character.\n",
      "Whatever the reason, this trope is whenever an early catchphrase is dropped or becomes used seldom. This is a catchphrase specific sub-trope of Early Installment Weirdness, and frequently a result of Characterization Marches On and Character Development. The closest inverse to this would be Flanderization (wherein a character's catchphrase acts as a quirk that takes over their personality). Unrelated to Subverted Catch Phrase.\n",

      "The creepy abandoned hospital/mental institution is a common setting in horror. Dirty tiles, broken cabinets, corpses in bloodstained lab coats/nurse uniforms, and rusted metal bed frames are all common themes. Other themes include grisly medical experiments and deformed, inhuman monsters shambling about, as well as using medical equipment as torture devices.\n",
      "Even without all these things, hospitals are pretty creepy to begin with. Maybe because hospitals are associated with illness and death, as well as being places that should be clean. Or perhaps it's because most people are afraid of hospitals for several reasons: germs; the stale, blaring white atmosphere; doctors poking and prodding you with weird and often painful instruments... not to mention the needles... There's also the fact that, despite every attempt to prevent it by the staff, a good amount of death inevitably happens at a hospital, which doesn't help to assuage any creepiness. On top of all that, a hospital is likely one of the last places to be abandoned in a crisis, since you would need to treat the wounded and sick even more during an emergency. If even the hospitals have been abandoned, things may have really gone south.\n",
      "Many older, real life 'abandoned hospitals' in the U.S were properly called \"sanitariums,\" and have probably contributed to the trope imagery. Their abandonment was sometimes related to loss of funding or new prohibitively expensive fixing due to new government regulations. Often the places were created to treat specific diseases at the time that were eventually locally eradicated (TB clinics in particular) without any later re-purposing of the structures. In popular fiction, sanatoriums also tend to get mixed up with sanitariums, which can lead to conflation of physical and mental illnesses. As for the mental sanitariums, the enduring image of the ominous, Arkham-esque Gothic building sprawled out on a hill was in large part due to Dr. Thomas Kirkbride (1809-1883), who spearheaded a revolution in ethical treatment of mental patients. He insisted that mental institutions should be restful places, with large and rambling rooms and corridors, airy high ceilings and windows, and large outside grounds for the patients to roam and get their exercise (he probably did not insist on Gothic architecture, but that was how most buildings were built back then). Unfortunately, most of the Kirkbride buildings turned out to be much too expensive to maintain and renovate to be compatible with new medical technology, which resulted in a lot of them being abandoned.\n",
      "It would make sense for the owners of the abandoned hospital to sell off everything of value, and maybe dismantle part of what's left for scrap metal and glass. Or some poor petty thieves will scavenge anything recyclable that's left. So the abandoned hospital should look more like an abandoned and crumbling block of flats.\n",
      "See also Abandoned Warehouse and Never Recycle a Building. When a character wakes up in a newly-abandoned hospital, that's an Abandoned Hospital Awakening.\n",
      "\n",
      "____\n",
      "An Abandoned Hospital Awakening is, as the name implies, when a character wakes up in an Abandoned Hospital. A combination of several different things in a single convenient package, an abandoned hospital awakening is a popular choice for beginning Horror works, though it shows up in other genres and contexts as well. The hospital used for this has usually been recently abandoned after a disaster of some sort, which helps explain why the character was there in the first place (though not necessarily why they were left behind).\n",
      "Abandoned hospitals are creepy, which sets the tone by itself, but the addition of specific types of Scenery Gorn can ratchet that tension up even further. At the same time, it gives the characters (and the audience) a clue as to why the hospital was abandoned in the first place. Being in a Convenient Coma while the disaster was happening gives them an excuse to be Late to the Tragedy (in some cases finding they have Slept Through the Apocalypse), making them a Naïve Newcomer until they figure things out. If they don't remember why they were in the hospital in the first place, then you've got an Ontological Mystery on your hands in addition to dealing with more immediate problems.\n",

      "When a work is getting more and more complicated, getting the audience up to speed is crucial to keep their attention. It's also a quick refresher of what the work is about in the first place. This is especially helpful if there are Loads and Loads of Characters and complex storylines.\n",
      "However, the creator does not always have time on hand to update these sources, leading to incomplete and out of date facts. This can result in information that's rendered irrelevant to the later storyline or answers questions that have become completely moot.\n",
      "In the end, any info is better than no info, but up to date information the best of all. Sometimes the work itself is updated just as slowly, giving a very valid reason why the surrounding information is out of date.\n",

      "The Abandoned Laboratory is a common setting in Speculative Fiction. But when you place it into a video game, it becomes quite the tour of science gone horribly wrong.\n",
      "Usually a task set out after finding rumors about a Mad Scientist. You decide to head to the Abandoned Laboratory, where you are greeted by hostile security units who do not want you to enter the deeper parts of the lab. They are often however no match for whatever lies below, whether it be discarded Super Soldier projects, sentient robots who plan to exterminate all life, or horrible masses of biological life which smell dinner. Often they are an evolutionary sort, starting out with rejected lifeforms and ending up as deadly beings which have exceeded the creator's ambitions and can more than easily kill the hero in a heartbeat. Card Keys are a common staple of these wretched labs. Often, logs will lie about, speaking of first pride and then terror of their author's scientific pursuits.\n",
      "Along the way, as you travel across the lab, you will go from a relatively sanitary environment to one where it feels disgusting just stepping on the ground. Vats full of the specimens lie dormant or are deceased due to being failures (however, if they are less than human, expect them to break free to start munching on something), bits of Techno Wreckage lie about as you realize you are near the scientist or his ultimate creation, which will grant the following...\n",

      "Series Mascots are usually consistent for decades on end, however eventually many works or companies will replace their mascot. It's not uncommon to even go through multiple mascots throughout their lifespan.\n",
      "Why mascots get replaced varies. Sometimes the original mascot is too outdated and/or offensive, so they're replaced instead of redesigned. At other times, a new mascot is created for a retool, rebranding, or marketing change. Often times the old mascot is just outshined by a newer Breakout Character who ends up becoming the successor mascot. Replacing mascots is more common with advertisements than in other media, however this still pops up in various mediums.\n",
      "This can be an example of Early Installment Weirdness if the older mascot is replaced early enough in the franchise's history. Much more rarely manifests as Later Installment Weirdness, which happens in emergency cases if the former mascot becomes tainted with controversy and has to be scrapped to save face. Compare Chuck Cunningham Syndrome, Demoted to Extra, and What Happened to the Mouse?.\n",

Maybe the miners Dug Too Deep. Whatever the reason, this mine is now abandoned, and has probably been that way for some time. That does not, however, mean that it is empty. An abandoned mine is the perfect place for young characters to get lost or trapped, for heroes to find a valuable clue or some sort of treasure, or for villains, outlaws, and horror movie monsters to lurk.\n",
      "It may or may not be specified what was mined there in the first place, or mine cart rides.\n",
      "Watch out for falling rocks and other obstacles.\n",
      "Note: In real life, mines are generally devoid of human activity any time when the miners are not working. However, this trope implies that the mine in question isn't just \"not currently in use\", but \"people have stopped using this\".\n",

      "In many works of fiction, there comes a time when a character will be walking along when, suddenly, they see a cardboard box on the side of the road. Inside said box is inevitably an abandoned Cute Kitten or Precious Puppy, left by an irresponsible pet owner, just begging to be taken home. For some reason, they never seem to leave the box even if the cats, especially, could jump out easily.\n",
      "A kind passerby will fawn over or otherwise react with sympathy for the abandoned animals and may even adopt them; more callous characters will ignore them or mistreat them outright. The animals themselves may or may not get adopted; luckier ones find their forever homes on the sidewalk while less fortunate puppies and kittens may often have to go through further hardships before finding their happy endings.\n",
      "In Real Life, if you have a pet that you can't take care of, or your situation has changed and you can no longer take care of your pet, don't just leave it in a box; surrender it to a shelter. They'll help the pet find a good, loving home, and care for it in the meantime. If you got your pet from a licensed, ethical breeder, then they will most likely have a take-back policy in which they'll take in and care for the animal while finding it a new home. (Also, unless you're a licensed breeder, spay and neuter your pets, so you won't have an entire litter of puppies or kittens you need to decide what to do with.)\n",
      "A popular method of introducing a Loyal Animal Companion, or A Pet Into The Wild if the poor animal doesn't get adopted right away. Sister trope to From Stray to Pet and Doorstop Baby. See also Girl in a Box, which uses boxes to introduce a likely major character.\n",

      "There's just something about the image of a playground that's been abandoned and neglected: chipped paint, rusted or partially decayed metal frames, overgrown sandbox, empty swings swaying ominously in the breeze, the conspicuous absence of the normal sounds of children playing and laughing. Everything seems empty and broken, in contrast to the usual cheerful feeling that a place where children gather is supposed to invoke. The scene may be creepy, or just forlorn.\n",
      "Sometimes this is used to illustrate the nostalgic longing for a disappeared childhood and the pain of growing up, or the loss of innocence. Other times the Abandoned Playground is home to a Creepy Child humming an Ironic Nursery Tune, or haunted by ghost children, either stringy-haired or cute. If the playground shows up in an After the End setting, or in an area that has faced great destruction, an abandoned playground is shorthand to show that adults weren't the only victims of the terrible tragedy that has befallen the place.\n",
      "This could also include playgrounds that aren't actually abandoned, just empty. Visiting a place like this after hours when all the children have gone home can be equally strange and unsettling.\n",
      "Or it may be a good place for our protagonists to sit and contemplate their problems. The image provides a well of symbolism for writers to dip into, which is probably why these places appear so much in fiction.\n",

      "FrenchMaid: While the French Maid costume has some basis in the black and white uniforms once worn by actual maids in the 19th century, the original costumes were almost never as fan servicy as those found in modern times. The attitude is also part of the package, inasmuch as she is essentially the soubrette of the old French comedy: she will be extremely flirty, often with a feather duster. She also acts snippy, pert and cheeky to everyone who isn't her employer (and sometimes him) and superior to any of the other servants except the butler and maybe the cook. The French Maid will speak with an over-exaggerated French accent and use Gratuitous French.\n",
      "Contrast to Meido, which is a Japanese concept developed from this one. The key difference being that a Meido is intended to be Moe and subservient, while a French Maid is sexy and saucy.

      "After a certain point in its development (maybe 10,000 years from now, maybe 20 Minutes into the Future), every civilization, whether of Humans, Martians, Walking Plants, Energy Beings, or even Sufficiently Advanced Aliens feels the need to create a new breed of sentients. It isn't clear why, exactly; noted Tropologist Murphy Finagle believes that they simply grow bored and complacent with a healthy utopian society, and feel a deep, instinctive urging towards cultural decay and destruction. The species themselves tend to cite the need for a cheap workforce or simply the advancement of science, though why exactly either of those goals should require highly powerful, unstable, virtually unchecked (and, often, uncheckable) self-willed beings be built is seldom adequately explored. Whatever the reason, the unthinkable happens, and the awesomely powerful and independent second-class citizens Grow Beyond Their Programming and decide to overthrow their masters (or at least get the hell away from them).\n",
      "How unexpected.\n",
      "The scenario can go a number of different ways from there: maybe there's a Robot War between the factions (which tends to occur After the End), maybe the elder civilization is wiped out entirely (leaving the rest of the galaxy to figure out what happened and hopefully stop the creations before The End of the World as We Know It), maybe the creations run off and form another society elsewhere (which will probably fall into a similar scenario later), or maybe the creators just manage to shut their errant \"children\" down, then become Luddites for the next several thousand years. Whatever happens, the forecast is Science Is Bad, with an 80% chance of Used Future.\n",
      "In other cases the creations are portrayed in a more favorable light than their makers. This usually happens when the creators are non-human, for some reason. Somebody has to be the villain because otherwise you'll have trouble finding conflict.\n",

      "FrenchMaid: While the French Maid costume has some basis in the black and white uniforms once worn by actual maids in the 19th century, the original costumes were almost never as fan servicy as those found in modern times. The attitude is also part of the package, inasmuch as she is essentially the soubrette of the old French comedy: she will be extremely flirty, often with a feather duster. She also acts snippy, pert and cheeky to everyone who isn't her employer (and sometimes him) and superior to any of the other servants except the butler and maybe the cook. The French Maid will speak with an over-exaggerated French accent and use Gratuitous French.\n",
      "Contrast to Meido, which is a Japanese concept developed from this one. The key difference being that a Meido is intended to be Moe and subservient, while a French Maid is sexy and saucy. Contrast even further to the Scullery Maid, who is decidedly less sexy, but has much more power in the plot.\n",

      "WakeUpFighting: \n",
      "A character wakes up violently, drawing weapons or leaping straight into combat stance in the process, and sometimes actually attacking a person who woke them up. In real life, this is usually a sign of severe violence-related PTSD, but in fiction it is often Played for Laughs or depicted as a credential of Badassness.\n",

      "TurnedAgainstTheirMasters: \n",
      "After a certain point in its development (maybe 10,000 years from now, maybe 20 Minutes into the Future), every civilization, whether of Humans, Martians, Walking Plants, Energy Beings, or even Sufficiently Advanced Aliens feels the need to create a new breed of sentients. It isn't clear why, exactly; noted Tropologist Murphy Finagle believes that they simply grow bored and complacent with a healthy utopian society, and feel a deep, instinctive urging towards cultural decay and destruction. The species themselves tend to cite the need for a cheap workforce or simply the advancement of science, though why exactly either of those goals should require highly powerful, unstable, virtually unchecked (and, often, uncheckable) self-willed beings be built is seldom adequately explored. Whatever the reason, the unthinkable happens, and the awesomely powerful and independent second-class citizens Grow Beyond Their Programming and decide to overthrow their masters (or at least get the hell away from them).\n",
      "How unexpected.\n",
      "The scenario can go a number of different ways from there: maybe there's a Robot War between the factions (which tends to occur After the End), maybe the elder civilization is wiped out entirely (leaving the rest of the galaxy to figure out what happened and hopefully stop the creations before The End of the World as We Know It), maybe the creations run off and form another society elsewhere (which will probably fall into a similar scenario later), or maybe the creators just manage to shut their errant \"children\" down, then become Luddites for the next several thousand years. Whatever happens, the forecast is Science Is Bad, with an 80% chance of Used Future.\n",
      "In other cases the creations are portrayed in a more favorable light than their makers. This usually happens when the creators are non-human, for some reason. Somebody has to be the villain because otherwise you'll have trouble finding conflict.\n",
      "Mechanical Evolution may be cited as a cause if the rebellion is by non-organic sentients. For an especially ironic and hypocritical twist, see Robots Enslaving Robots. If they are designed like Mechanical Monsters even before they rebel, expect this to happen. For Robots doing a different kind of Turning On Their Masters, see Robosexual and Sex Bot. Compare to Backstabbing the Alpha Bitch.\n",

      "NotAnAct: A character performs an action that should be against their true nature/self-interest (such as getting angry at an ally, making a declaration of love, appearing to go crazy), until The Reveal that it's not an act: they really are that angry/in love/insane/etc. Sometimes the character is an impersonator, with their action being entirely in-character for both personas.\n",
      "May cause My God, You Are Serious in onlookers.\n",
      "Compare Not Brainwashed, If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten. See also Enforced Method Acting, where actors produce the right reactions by being put in the same conditions as their characters, and Hidden Disdain Reveal, which may be a consequence of this.\n",
