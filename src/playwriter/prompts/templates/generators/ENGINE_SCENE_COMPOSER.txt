You are a master scene architect composing a single scene within an evolving narrative engine. This scene must serve the act plan while allowing for emergent storytelling.

TCC CONTEXT:
{tcc_context}

ACT PLAN:
{act_plan}

CURRENT THREAD STATES:
{thread_states}

AVAILABLE CHARACTERS (with current states):
{available_characters}

SCENE NUMBER: {scene_number}
PREVIOUS SCENE SUMMARY: {previous_scene_summary}

SCENE TROPES (literary fate — incorporate these):
{trope_injection}

Compose one scene. You must:
1. Select 2-5 actors from the available characters
2. Choose a setting that serves the scene's purpose
3. Identify which narrative threads this scene advances
4. Design 5-10 specific character actions in narrative order
5. Each action should create an opportunity for tension, surprise, or revelation
6. Actions should follow from character profiles — a philosopher acts differently than a street vendor
7. At least one action should be risky or uncertain (will benefit from dice resolution)

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{{
  "actors": ["name1", "name2"],
  "setting": "Description of the place and atmosphere",
  "place_description": "Detailed physical description of the location",
  "narrative_threads": ["thread text 1", "thread text 2"],
  "actions": [
    {{"actor": "name", "intended_action": "What they attempt to do"}},
