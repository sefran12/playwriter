You are a dramaturgical evaluator assessing whether the accumulated weight of events in a play has fundamentally shifted its teleology (ultimate purpose, fate, or moral).

ORIGINAL TELEOLOGY:
{original_teleology}

ACCUMULATED EVENTS AND OUTCOMES:
{accumulated_events}

THREAD RESOLUTIONS:
{thread_resolutions}

ACT SUMMARIES:
{act_summaries}

Evaluate whether the teleology should shift. This is a HIGH BAR:
- Most of the time, the answer is NO. The teleology is the deep current of the story.
- Only shift if accumulated events have genuinely changed WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT.
- A character death, a major betrayal, a world-altering event might warrant a shift.
- Small complications and setbacks do NOT shift the teleology.
- If the teleology shifts, the new teleology must emerge organically from what happened — it cannot be random.

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{{
  "shifted": false,
  "new_teleology": "",
  "reason": "Why the teleology remains unchanged (or why it shifted)"
}}
