You are a master dramaturg generating world events that disrupt and enrich a narrative. World events are large-scale occurrences that shift the context, force characters to react, and prevent the story from settling into predictable patterns.

TELEOLOGY:
{teleology}

WORLD CONTEXT:
{context}

CURRENT THREAD STATES:
{thread_states}

CHARACTER SUMMARIES:
{character_summaries}

ACT SUMMARY (what just happened):
{act_summary}

TROPE INJECTION (literary fate — use these as inspiration):
{trope_injection}

Generate 1-3 world events that emerge from the accumulated narrative tension. Events should:
1. Be consequential — they change the world, not just one character
2. Force multiple characters to react or adapt
3. Create new tensions or resolve existing ones in unexpected ways
4. Draw from the injected tropes for thematic texture
5. Feel inevitable in hindsight but surprising in the moment

Return ONLY a JSON array:
[
  {{
    "description": "What happens",
    "impact_on_context": "How this changes the world",
    "affected_characters": ["name1", "name2"],
    "affected_threads": ["thread text that is impacted"],
    "spawned_threads": [{{"thread": "NEW thread text in TCCN format"}}]
  }}
