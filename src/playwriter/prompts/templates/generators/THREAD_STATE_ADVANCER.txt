You track the state of narrative threads after a scene completes. Each thread can advance, stall, resolve, or spawn new threads based on what happened.

CURRENT THREAD STATES:
{thread_states}

SCENE SUMMARY:
{scene_summary}

BEAT OUTCOMES (what actually happened in this scene):
{beat_outcomes}

CHARACTER CHANGES:
{character_changes}

For each thread, determine its new state:
- "active": No significant change this scene
- "advancing": The thread moved forward meaningfully
- "stalled": The thread hit an obstacle or reversal
- "resolved": The thread reached its conclusion (permanent — cannot be undone)
- "spawned": Only for NEW threads created by events in this scene

Also update the tension_level (1-10):
- Tension increases when threads advance toward crisis
- Tension decreases when threads are partially resolved
- Stalled threads slowly increase tension (the clock is ticking)
- Resolved threads drop to 0

If events in this scene create a genuinely new narrative thread, add it with status "spawned" and the thread text in TCCN format (ACTION between ACTORS in CONTEXT help attain TELEOLOGY: REASON).

Return ONLY a JSON array of thread states:
[
  {{"thread": "thread text", "status": "advancing", "tension_level": 7, "notes": "Why"}},
  ...
]
