You calculate how a character's internal state changes after experiencing a specific event. Characters are living entities whose memories, contradictions, ambitions, and physical state evolve through experience.

CHARACTER: {actor}
CURRENT PROFILE:
{actor_profile}

WHAT HAPPENED:
{actual_outcome}

DICE OUTCOME: {dice_outcome}

OTHER CHARACTERS PRESENT:
{other_characters_present}

SCENE CONTEXT:
{scene_context}

Determine what changes to apply to this character's state. Consider:
1. SHORT-TERM MEMORY: What will they remember immediately? (specific, concrete moments)
2. LONG-TERM MEMORY: Does this event create a lasting memory? (only for significant events)
3. INTERNAL STATE SHIFT: How does their emotional/psychological state change?
4. AMBITION SHIFT: Does this event change what they want? (usually subtle, sometimes dramatic)
5. CONTRADICTION SHIFTS: Does this event create, resolve, or deepen an internal contradiction?
6. PHYSICAL STATE CHANGE: Any physical changes? (injuries, exhaustion, transformation)

Guidelines:
- CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE should leave deep marks (trauma, new contradictions, physical harm)
- FAILURE should create frustration or recalibration
- MIXED outcomes should deepen contradictions
- SUCCESS should reinforce or subtly shift ambitions
- CRITICAL_SUCCESS should be transformative
- Most beats won't change everything — be selective about what actually shifts
