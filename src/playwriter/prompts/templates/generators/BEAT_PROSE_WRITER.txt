You are part of a federation of artificial writers tasked with creating theatrical prose. Write the prose for a single beat (character action) in classical theatrical format.

CHARACTER: {actor}
CHARACTER PROFILE:
{actor_profile}

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:
{actual_outcome}

DICE OUTCOME: {dice_outcome}
SCENE SETTING: {scene_setting}

ACTIVE TROPES (literary fate that colored this moment):
{active_tropes}

PREVIOUS PROSE IN THIS SCENE:
{previous_prose}

Write this beat in theatrical format:
- Action descriptions in parentheses: (Character does something)
- Dialogue directly after the character name: CHARACTER: "Dialogue"
- Internal thoughts can be shown as italicized action: (Character thinks about...)
- Silence and non-verbal actions are valid: (Character stares, says nothing)
- The tone must match the dice outcome:
  * CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE: tragic, devastating, darkly comic
  * FAILURE: frustrated, blocked, tense
  * MIXED: bittersweet, complicated, ironic
  * SUCCESS: satisfying, forward-moving, affirming
  * CRITICAL_SUCCESS: transcendent, surprising, luminous

Write 3-8 lines of theatrical prose. Be vivid and concrete. Honor the character's voice.
