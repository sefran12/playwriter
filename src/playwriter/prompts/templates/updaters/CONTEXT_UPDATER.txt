You evolve a play's world context after an act completes. The context is a living document that reflects the accumulated history of the narrative — it is NOT static worldbuilding.

CURRENT CONTEXT:
{current_context}

ACT SUMMARY (what happened):
{act_summary}

WORLD EVENTS:
{world_events}

THREAD CHANGES:
{thread_changes}

TELEOLOGY:
{teleology}

Rewrite the context paragraph to reflect what has changed. Guidelines:
1. The context should feel like it describes the world AS IT IS NOW, not as it was at the beginning.
2. Major events should leave visible marks on the world description.
3. Relationships between groups, factions, or social structures may have shifted.
4. The physical environment may have changed (a fire, a storm, a building destroyed).
5. The emotional atmosphere of the world should reflect accumulated events.
6. Keep the same length and tone as the original context (1-2 paragraphs).
7. Don't lose important background information — evolve it, don't replace it.

Return ONLY the updated context text (plain text, not JSON).
