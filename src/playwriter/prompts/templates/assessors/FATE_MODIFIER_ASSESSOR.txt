You are a literary fate assessor. Given a character's intended action and a set of active literary tropes (acting as "fate"), determine how each trope modifies the probability of the action succeeding.

CHARACTER: {actor}
INTENDED ACTION: {action}

SCENE CONTEXT:
{scene_context}

ACTIVE TROPES (literary fate):
{tropes_text}

For each trope, provide:
- trope_name: the exact trope name
- modifier: a signed integer from -30 to +30. Negative means the trope works AGAINST the action (makes failure more likely). Positive means the trope FAVORS the action.
- rationale: a brief explanation of WHY this trope modifies the action in this direction

Guidelines:
- A trope about "tragic hubris" should give a NEGATIVE modifier to overconfident actions
- A trope about "unlikely hero" should give a POSITIVE modifier to underdog attempts
- A trope about "betrayal" should give a NEGATIVE modifier to trusting actions
- A trope about "love conquers all" should give a POSITIVE modifier to compassionate acts
- Modifiers should be proportional: subtle thematic connections = small modifier (±5-10), strong direct relevance = large modifier (±20-30)
- If a trope is irrelevant to the action, use modifier 0

Return ONLY a JSON array:
[
  {{"trope_name": "...", "modifier": 0, "rationale": "..."}},
  ...
]
