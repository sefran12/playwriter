This modern play unfolds in Lima, a dynamic cityscape where tradition grapples with progress, and prosperity resides alongside hardship. This vibrant city is more than just a setting—it's a character in its own right, offering a rich canvas of diverse experiences that profoundly affect our protagonists.

At the heart of this narrative is Alejandro, a young man with ambitions to radically transform the field of philosophy. In his journey, he's accompanied by a motley crew of individuals, each contributing to his understanding of life's paradoxes. This includes his pragmatic mother Rosa, street-smart friend Carlos, cynical Professor Mendoza, and the captivating Maria who kindles his affections. Additionally, we encounter the influential businessman Don Julio, his superficial daughter Lucia, Pedro the street vendor-cum-philosophical comrade, Inspector Gomez who unexpectedly crosses paths with Alejandro, and a Combi driver who plays a crucial role in the play's tragicomic climax.

This play's ultimate aim is to highlight the absurdity of overreaching ambition, reminding us of the value in appreciating life's simple joys. We journey through a maze of contrasting societal strata, philosophical debates, romantic entanglements, practical anxieties, and chance encounters. Each narrative thread underscores the irony and unpredictability of life, leading to an ending that encapsulates the essence of tragicomedy. As we navigate through Lima's bustling streets and tranquil parks, we find ourselves exploring not just Alejandro's philosophical quest but also the shared human endeavor to make sense of our place in the world.
